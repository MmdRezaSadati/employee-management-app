- **Version**: `0.1.0`

### Scripts

The following scripts are accessible via npm to manage the application:

- **dev**: This script starts the Next.js development server.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **build**: Prepares the application for production deployment by creating an optimized build.
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **start**: Launches the application in production mode.
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **lint**: Runs a linter to check the project for code quality and style issues.
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Dependencies

The application relies on several essential packages, including:

- `@nextui-org/react`: Provides React components for Next.js applications.
- `@reduxjs/toolkit`: Simplifies Global State management using Redux.
- `@tanstack/react-query`: A powerful library for managing server state and caching.
